# FiveM Vehicle Spawncode Renamer
This script will rename the spawncode of your vehicle

### Folder Layout:
- Main Folder - Stream Folder, Meta Files (vehicles.meta, handling.meta, carcols.meta and carvariations.meta)
- Stream Folder - YFT and YTDs of your vehicle

 ### Installation Instructions:
1. Ensure you have NodeJS installed
2. Place your vehicle / pack into the *car* folder
3. Run the bat file and enter the current spawncode and the one you want to set it to
4. Check it worked, take your files back out the car folder

``You can run this without all the meta files, it will just only merge the ones included.``\
